## 1) About

Simutrans-Extended (formerly Simutrans-Experimental) is a fork of the popular open source transport simulation game, Simutrans. Your goal is to establish a successful transport company. Transport passengers, mail and goods by rail, road, ship, and even air. Interconnect districts, cities, public buildings, industries and tourist attractions by building a transport network you always dreamed of.

## 1.1) Download Simutrans-Extended

You can download Simutrans-Extended from:

- [Bridgewater-Brunel Simutrans-Extended server](http://bridgewater-brunel.me.uk/downloads/nightly/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/434520/Simutrans/) (opting in the "extended" beta branch)

Simutrans-Extended is updated nightly, so you will need an up-to-date game to play network games. For this purpose, an [automatic updater is available](http://bridgewater-brunel.me.uk/downloads/Nightly%20Updater%20V2.zip) (requires Java 9 or later). If you play Simutrans-Extended on Steam, the Steam client will take care of updates for you.

## 2) Compiling Simutrans-Extended

This is a short guide on compiling Simutrans-Extended. If you want more detailed information, read the [Compiling Simutrans](https://simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/en_CompilingSimutrans) wiki page. Note: A system set up to compile Simutrans should be able to compile Simutrans-Extended.

If you are on Windows, download either [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). MSVC is easy for debugging, MSYS2 is easy to set up (but it has to be done on the command line).

### 2.1) Getting the Source Code

You can download the latest version with a git client:
```
git clone https://github.com/jamespetts/simutrans-extended.git
```

### 2.2) Getting the libraries

This is a list of libraries used by Simutrans-Extended. Not all of them are necessary, some are optional, so pick them according to your needs. Read below about how to install them.

You will also need pkgconfig (Unix) or [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) (MSVC + CMake)

- MSVC + CMake: Install libaries using vpkg `./vcpkg/vcpkg --triplet x64-windows-static install zlib bzip2 libpng zstd sdl2 freetype miniupnpc`
- MSVC (alone): You will need to download libraries manually. Check [How to compile Simutrans Extended with Visual Studio 2015](https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,14254.msg194481.html#msg194481) for more info.
- MSYS2: Run [setup-mingw.sh](https://github.com/aburch/simutrans/blob/master/tools/setup-mingw.sh) to get the libraries and set up the environment.
- Linux: Use [pkgs.org](https://pkgs.org/) to search for development libraries available in your package manager.
- Mac: Install libraries via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### 2.3) Compiling

Go to the source code directory of simutrans-extended. You have three build systems to choose from: make, MSVC, and CMake. We recommend make or MSVC for debug builds.

Compiling will give you only the executable, you still need a Simutrans-Extended installation to run the program. You can start simutrans-extended with `-use_workdir` to point it to an existing installation.

#### 2.3.1) Compiling with make

The executable will be built in build/default.

```
(Linux) autoconf
(MacOS) autoreconf -ivf
./configure
make -j 4
(MacOS) make OSX/getversion
```

#### 2.3.2) Compiling with Microsoft Visual Studio

Open [Simutrans-Extended.sln](./Simutrans-Extended.sln), choose the configuration you want and compile.

#### 2.3.3) Compiling with CMake

The executable will be built in build/simutrans-extended.

##### Linux/MinGW/MacOS
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Insert Correct Makefiles Generator" ..
cmake --build . -j 4
```
See [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) for a list of generators.

##### MSVC
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake.exe .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg-root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### 2.4) Cross-Compiling
